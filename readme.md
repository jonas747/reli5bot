####Simple bot for http://reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive

To compile it install go and run the command `go get github.com/jonas747/reli5bot`

 - config.json contains cofiguration options
 - data.json contains a list of all the threads the bot has sent a message to the author for

To run the bot, place both these files in the same directory as the executable and you're good to go.
